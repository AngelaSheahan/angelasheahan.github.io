# Goofie Games for kids
Goofie Games website is a landing page for parents and children looking for recommended FUN computer games for kids aged 6 - 12.

Users of this website will be able to find a list of FUN computer games, ones to buy and ones for free. There will be a link to a trailer for each game, followed by an image of the game and a summary of the game. Kids will be able to sign up as Goofie Game club members and make their own recomendations. There will be a weekly 'recommended by' section where one of our members recommendation will be displayed.

## Features (PAGE 1 - HOME PAGE)

### The Header

#### Banner
- This banner was created in Adobe Express. This banner is displayed on all 3 pages of my site.

#### Navigation bar
- The navigation bar consists of three links on the left: Home, Fun Games and My Favourite. The navigation bar is fully responsive and allows for easy navigation. 

### The Body
- The background for my Home Page is made up of an image I sourced from pexel.com
- A Level 1 heading -  "What Are We About?"
- An unordered list, listing the 4 objectives of this website.

### The Footer
- A 'Contact Us' text heading
- A contact email link for my site
- Social media links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram



## FEATURES (PAGE 2 - FUN GAMES PAGE)
The purpose of this page is to introduce the user to an age-appropriate FUN game via:
- Game trailer (Embedded video)
- Game image
- Game description
- PEGI age rating icon
- Device icons (representing on which devices the game can play). 

### FEATURES (PAGE 3 - MY FAVOURITE PAGE)
- The 'My Favourites Page' also displays the hero image from the Home Page as its background.  This page also displays a form to be completed by a child so he/she can become members of the Goofie Games club.
- The form collects:
    - the child's name (first name, last name) & age
    - parent/guardians email address
    - childs game recommendation
    - the device on which he/she plays this game
    - A 'Why I like this game' textarea.
- The form is valuable to the child because the child can give his/her game recommendation(s), which will be saved on the site and can be choosen to be displayed on the Home Page on a particular week.

### Contact Section

### Features Left to Implement
The 'Best Recommended Game Winner' section, where a members' game recommendation (after having being vetted) will be randomly selected to be displayed on the Home Page of my site.
