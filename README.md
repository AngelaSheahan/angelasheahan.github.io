# Goofie Games for kids
Goofie Games website is a landing page for parents and children looking for recommended FUN computer games for kids aged 6 - 12.

Users of this website will be able to find a list of FUN computer games, ones to buy and ones for free. There will be a link to a trailer for each game, followed by an image of the game and a summary of the game. Kids will be able to sign up as Goofie Game club members and make their own recomendations. There will be a weekly 'recommended by' section where one of our members recommendation will be displayed.

- The 'My Favourites Page' also displays the hero image from the Home Page as its background.  This page also displays a form to be completed by a child so he/she can become members of the Goofie Games club.
- The form collects:
    - the child's name (first name, last name) & age
    - parent/guardians email address
    - childs game recommendation
    - the device on which he/she plays this game
    - A 'Why I like this game' textarea.
- The form is valuable to the child because the child can give his/her game recommendation(s), which will be saved on the site and can be choosen to be displayed on the Home Page on a particular week.

### Contact Section

### Features Left to Implement
The 'Best Recommended Game Winner' section, where a members' game recommendation (after having being vetted) will be randomly selected to be displayed on the Home Page of my site.
